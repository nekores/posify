# Development testing

# 1. Build Next.js

# The DMG will be in: dist/Posify-1.0.0.dmg



npm run electron:build:mac:arm64


Important notes
Database required: Ensure PostgreSQL is running and configured in .env.local
First build may take a few minutes to package dependencies
Icons: The build works without icons. To add icons later, create public/icon.icns (512x512px)
Security: On first launch, users may need to right-click → Open (macOS Gatekeeper)
The DMG file will be created in the dist/ directory after running the build command. See BUILD_GUIDE.md for detailed instructions and troubleshooting.
